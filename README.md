# ppcc
A Powerpoint Compiler

## Abstract

What if you could code in Powerpoint?

Tom Wildenhain produced [PPTXTM](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/twildenh/PowerPointTM/Paper.pdf), a Turing Machine that could function entirely in Powerpoint. The implications? Groundbreaking. The usability? Lacking. To operate the PPTXTM, one needs to write executable punch cards; a technique made obsolete in the 1960s. 

We introduce PPCPU, a cpu functioning entirely in Powerpoint. This includes 256 bytes of memory, 8 registers, and several Arithmetic Logic Units.
