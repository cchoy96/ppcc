A Powerpoint Compiler

## Abstract

Through the work of Tom Wildenhain, Powerpoint has been proven and well documented as a complete Turing Machine. Notably, they contributed turing-complete [PPTXTM](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/twildenh/PowerPointTM/Paper.pdf). In this project, we aim to create a compiler that can run C-syntax code in PPTXTM; thereby further bridging the gap between today and a future where all applications may be run in Powerpoint.
